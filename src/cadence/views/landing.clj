         [:p "Cadence authentication is a bit different than password
             authentication.  Typically you only have one password per site
          (sometimes fewer). You type this password in or your browser may fill
          it in for you, you click the \"login\" button and you're done.  Of
          course, you already know all that because you've been using passwords
          for most of your life. Theoretically, passwords work from a security
             standpoint.  However, they are often exploited since most users
          don't use them properly. For more on this (and the science behind
             cadence) see "

             given phrase. Using some pattern recognition algorithms the way the
             user typed in the given phrase is compared to past entries and
             classified as authentic or not. An authentic entry authenticates the
             user and an unauthentic entry requires he or she tries again."]

             time the user types in a specific phrase? Well, that's what
             training is for.  In order to do authentication a classifier must
             be created and trained for that specific user.  During the training
             process the user is given a phrase and types it in until they are
             prompted to stop. Cadence.js is the tool that helps us with this.
